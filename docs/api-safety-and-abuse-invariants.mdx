title: API Safety & Abuse Invariants
description: Non-negotiable rules to prevent abusive usage and runaway costs for Vibecodr APIs

# API Safety & Abuse Invariants

This checklist defines **hard invariants** for how we expose and protect Vibecodr APIs, to prevent abusive usage (bots, scripts, spam) from turning into runaway cost or security issues.

Use this doc when:
- Adding a new endpoint or modifying an existing one
- Reviewing product flows that call `/api/*`
- Designing new features that hit external services (GitHub, proxies, etc.)

If any invariant would be violated by a change, **the change is not allowed** without a deliberate design doc and explicit sign-off.

---

## 1) Surface Area Invariants

- **[INV-API-0001] No dev/ops actions over HTTP**
  - **Goal**: Seeds, migrations, and ops scripts must never be triggerable by public HTTP requests.
  - **Examples of what we are preventing**
    - Hitting an undocumented `/api/admin/seed` that runs `seed-dev.sql` on production.
    - Any endpoint that shells out to `wrangler d1 execute` or similar.
  - **How we enforce it**
    - Seeds/migrations live as **files + CLI scripts only**:
      - e.g. `src/seed-dev.sql`, `db:migrate`, `d1:seed:*` in `package.json`.
    - No route in `workers/api/src/index.ts` may call these; they are wired only via `npm/pnpm` scripts.

- **[INV-API-0002] No public “platform” API (for now)**
  - **Goal**: The API exists only to serve our own UI and first-party flows, not arbitrary third-party integrations.
  - **Examples of what we are preventing**
    - Publishing a public docs page that says “here is our REST API, use it however you like.”
    - Adding `apiKeys` table + issuing keys to arbitrary developers pre-SaaS maturity.
  - **How we enforce it**
    - Treat all `/api/*` endpoints as **UI-only**, subject to UI-driven rate and quota assumptions.
    - If we ever add a real developer platform, it should have its own doc + key model.

## 2) Auth & Identity Invariants

- **[INV-API-0100] All write endpoints require auth**
  - **Goal**: Any endpoint that changes state must tie usage to an authenticated user.
  - **Examples of what we are preventing**
    - Anonymous `POST /api/capsules/publish` creating capsules in bulk.
    - Anonymous `POST /api/posts/:id/like` or `/comments` that can be scripted.
  - **How we enforce it**
    - Wrap Handlers for writes in `requireAuth` / `requireUser`.
    - Quick check: if the endpoint does `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` on D1 (or writes to R2, queues), it **must** use an auth wrapper.

- **[INV-API-0101] Sensitive admin/mod endpoints require role checks**
  - **Goal**: Moderation and admin actions should be limited to moderators/admins, not just "any logged-in user".
  - **Examples of what we are preventing**
    - Normal users calling `POST /api/moderation/posts/:id/action` to quarantine others' content.
    - Users closing moderation reports on themselves.
  - **How we enforce it**
    - Use `isModeratorOrAdmin` (from `auth.ts`) in moderation handlers.
    - Refuse with 403 if user lacks required role.

## 3) Rate Limiting & Quota Invariants

- **[INV-API-0200] Public read endpoints must have upstream rate limits**
  - **Goal**: Even for cheap reads, we cap worst-case abuse.
  - **Examples of what we are preventing**
    - A botnet hammering `GET /api/posts` or `GET /api/users/:handle` at hundreds of QPS.
    - Automated scraping of every profile and feed at high speed.
  - **How we enforce it**
    - Cloudflare WAF and/or rate-limiting rules for `/api/*`:
      - e.g. `GET /api/*`: per-IP and per-ASN limits (e.g. 60 requests/minute/IP as a starting point).
    - Tighten rules specifically on:
      - `/api/capsules/*`
      - `/api/proxy`
      - `/api/oembed`, `/e/:id` if abused for scraping.

- **[INV-API-0201] Expensive actions are quota-limited per user**
  - **Goal**: Tie cost to users and their plan; cap worst-case daily/monthly spend.
  - **Examples of what we are preventing**
    - A single user importing hundreds of GitHub repos or publishing thousands of capsules in a day.
    - A script repeatedly triggering WebContainer runs or heavy builds.
  - **How we enforce it** (target design)
    - Maintain a `usage` table keyed by `(userId, date, actionType)` with counters.
    - Before heavy actions (e.g., `publishCapsule`, `importGithub`, future build pipelines), we:
      - Read current usage for that user.
      - Compare against their plan's allotment.
      - Return `429` or `402` with a clear message if exceeded (and do **not** perform the action).
    - Plans & quotas are documented in Plans/Quotas docs and enforced consistently.

## 4) External Calls & Proxy Invariants

- **[INV-API-0300] Network proxy and external fetches are allowlisted**
  - **Goal**: Prevent using our infra as a generic HTTP proxy.
  - **Examples of what we are preventing**
    - Attackers using `/api/proxy` to hit arbitrary hosts.
    - Capsules or users abusing external calls to launch attacks or exfiltrate data.
  - **How we enforce it**
    - Proxy handler only allows hosts listed in allowlist (e.g. `ALLOWLIST_HOSTS`, manifest `net: []`).
    - Validate URLs and reject any host not in the allowlist.

- **[INV-API-0301] External calls are bounded & time-limited**
  - **Goal**: No unbounded retries or super-long upstream timeouts.
  - **Examples of what we are preventing**
    - Long-hanging requests to GitHub or other APIs that consume Workers CPU and concurrency.
  - **How we enforce it**
    - Use reasonable timeouts and limit per-request fan-out.
    - Avoid unbounded loops making external calls inside a single request.

## 5) Cost & Billing Guardrails

- **[INV-API-0400] Assume hostile automation exists**
  - **Goal**: Design as if bots will hit every public endpoint.
  - **Examples of what we are preventing**
    - Relying on "security by obscurity" like unlinked routes or weird paths.
  - **How we enforce it**
    - Run threat modeling when adding new endpoints:
      - "What if someone hits this 10k times per day?"
      - "What if they run this on every post/capsule?"
    - Answer with: **rate limits + auth + quotas + bounded work**.

- **[INV-API-0401] Billing alerts & caps configured in Cloudflare**
  - **Goal**: A config/ops-level circuit breaker in case dev-level invariants fail.
  - **Examples of what we are preventing**
    - Discovering a surprise multi-thousand-dollar bill after a weekend.
  - **How we enforce it**
    - Configure available billing alerts / caps for Workers, D1, and R2.
    - Periodically review usage dashboards and adjust limits/quotas.

## 6) UI-to-API Expectations

- **[INV-API-0500] UI calls only approved endpoints**
  - **Goal**: Frontend only hits a constrained set of routes with known cost profiles.
  - **Examples of what we are preventing**
    - Ad-hoc `fetch("/api/*")` from UI components to experimental endpoints without safeguards.
  - **How we enforce it**
    - Centralize API client helpers in a small module.
    - Avoid inlining random `/api/...` URLs deep inside components; route them through typed helpers when possible.

- **[INV-API-0501] No client-side secrets in API usage**
  - **Goal**: Never expose privileged keys or credentials in the browser.
  - **Examples of what we are preventing**
    - Putting GitHub personal access tokens or other API keys directly into frontend code.
  - **How we enforce it**
    - All secrets stay in server-side env vars or Workers bindings.
    - Frontend talks to our Worker, and the Worker talks to third-party APIs using secure bindings.

## 7) Examples: What We Are Specifically Guarding Against

This section collects concrete abuse scenarios and maps them to invariants above.

- **Scenario A: Import spam from GitHub**
  - Attacker writes a script that calls `POST /api/import/github` thousands of times using free accounts.
  - **Impact**: High CPU, external bandwidth, possible D1/R2 usage, unexpected bills.
  - **Mitigations**
    - Auth required for `import/github` and associated publish/build endpoints. (**INV-API-0100**)
    - Per-user `import` quota per day/plan. (**INV-API-0201**)
    - WAF rate limits per IP and per route. (**INV-API-0200**)

- **Scenario B: Capsule/run exhaustion**
  - Automated tools repeatedly hit `GET /api/capsules/:id/bundle` and any future run endpoints.
  - **Impact**: R2 egress, Workers CPU, possible D1 churn.
  - **Mitigations**
    - Rate limits on `/api/capsules/*`. (**INV-API-0200**)
    - If we later introduce a "run" endpoint, enforce auth + per-user run quotas. (**INV-API-0100**, **INV-API-0201**)

- **Scenario C: Social spam (likes/comments/follows)**
  - A script uses valid auth tokens to mass-like, follow, or comment across many posts.
  - **Impact**: DB growth, noise, potential moderation burden.
  - **Mitigations**
    - Auth required for all social write endpoints. (**INV-API-0100**)
    - Per-user daily limits on likes/follows/comments. (**INV-API-0201**)
    - Potentially CAPTCHAs/Turnstile for suspicious traffic patterns.

- **Scenario D: Proxy abuse**
  - Attackers try to use our `/api/proxy` as a general-purpose HTTP proxy.
  - **Impact**: Bandwidth abuse, potential legal/abuse complaints.
  - **Mitigations**
    - Strict host allowlist from manifest/vars. (**INV-API-0300**)
    - Per-route rate limits. (**INV-API-0200**)

## 8) How to Use This Checklist When Coding

When adding or changing an endpoint:

1. **Classify it**
   - Is it read-only or write?
   - Does it touch external services? Is it heavy?

2. **Apply invariants**
   - For writes: ensure auth. (**INV-API-0100**)
   - For admin/mod: ensure role checks. (**INV-API-0101**)
   - For external/proxy: enforce allowlists. (**INV-API-0300**)
   - For heavy actions: think about quotas & rate limits. (**INV-API-0200/0201**)

3. **Document assumptions**
   - If an endpoint is intentionally cheap and public, note that.
   - If it relies on WAF/rate limits, ensure those rules exist in Cloudflare.

This doc should evolve as we learn more. Any time we discover a new class of abuse or unexpected cost, add it as a scenario and tighten the relevant invariants.
