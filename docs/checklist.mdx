# Vibecodr Website Build Checklist

Use this start-to-finish checklist to ship the MVP described in mvp-plan.md and the supporting research docs. Organized by lifecycle and mapped to Phases 1–4. Check items in order; defer any “Later” items until post-MVP.

## 0) Project Foundations (Phase 1)
- [X] Monorepo skeleton ready (e.g., Turborepo) with `apps/web` and `packages/*` if needed
- [X] Next.js (App Router) initialized with TypeScript strict mode
- [X] TailwindCSS configured and working in `apps/web`
- [X] shadcn/ui installed and baseline theme tokens established
- [X] Lucide icons installed and integrated
- [ ] ESLint + Prettier + strict TS config; CI treats lints as errors
- [X] Git hooks (lint-staged + pretty-quick) or equivalent
- [X] .env example committed with all required variables (no secrets)
- [ ] Basic README with local dev and deploy steps

## 1) Cloudflare Platform Setup (Phase 1)

- [X] Workers project configured for API routes (wrangler.toml checked in)
- [X] D1 database created and bound (wrangler bindings)
- [X] R2 bucket created and bound for capsule bundles/assets
- [X] Durable Objects namespace created and bound (BuildCoordinator)
- [X] Workers Analytics Engine enabled and bound
- [ ] Domain + SSL configured; custom domain routed to Pages
- [ ] Secrets configured in Cloudflare (auth provider keys, PostHog, etc.)

## 2) Auth and Accounts (Phase 1)

- [x] OAuth (GitHub + Google) configured
- [ ] Session handling verified on Workers/Pages
- [X] Basic user model integrated with D1
- [X] Protected routes, soft auth gating for create/publish/remix

## 3) Database & Schema (Phase 1)
- [X] Choose Drizzle or Kysely; migrations pipeline established

- [X] Indices for feed sorts and lookups (created_at, author_id, parent_id, type)
- [X] Seed script and fixtures for local/dev
- [X] Typed query layer + Zod schemas for API contracts

## 4) Feed (Phase 1 → 3)
- [X] Card components: App and Report (Live shows “Coming Soon”)
- [X] Badges on cards: runner, net access, params count

- [X] Hover preview: preboot capsule in isolated iframe (perf budget 250–500ms)
- [X] Sorting: Latest (MVP) and Following
- [ ] Preload manifests via IntersectionObserver
- [ ] 60fps scroll maintained; heavy work deferred to Player
- [X] Empty/loading/error states
- [X] Inline preview click-to-run inside the card; instantiate runner on click
- [X] WebContainer preview: instantiate only on click; no hover preboot; show skeleton until ready
- [X] Concurrency cap for previews (e.g., max 1–2 active containers); queue additional clicks
- [ ] If budgets exceeded, prompt to open full Player and preserve state

## 5) Player (Phase 1 → 2)
- [X] Iframe sandbox configured with strict `sandbox` attrs (deny-by-default)
- [X] Strict CSP aligned to runner constraints (default-src 'none', allowlists)
- [X] Right drawer tabs: Notes, Remix, Chat (Chat can be simplified MVP)
- [X] Bottom bar: restart, performance meter, params, share, report
- [X] postMessage bridge: ready → setParam(name,value) → logs/stats
- [ ] Console proxy → analytics (sampled)
- [ ] Restart without full reload when possible
- [X] Capability badges surfaced (net/storage/workers)
- [X] Micro-Player variant reused in feed cards to avoid duplicated logic
- [ ] Preview-to-Player handoff preserves param state and logs

## 6) Manifest & Runner (Phase 2)

- [ ] Entry detection + size checks; SSR/server-only code flagged
- [ ] Params designer with live preview bound to Player
- [ ] Files editor for entry/assets/manifest.json with validation
- [ ] Publish flow: title, tags, cover, visibility, capability prompts, dry-run check
- [ ] Output immutable bundle to R2 with content hash keys
- [ ] Manifest stored/linked in D1; integrity hash captured
- [ ] License detection (SPDX) surfaced; warnings if missing

## 8) Storage & Asset Policy (Phase 2)

- [ ] Zero-egress paths confirmed for feed + player
- [ ] Integrity verification on load (hash)
- [X] Bundle cap enforced by plan (25MB Free/Creator; 100MB Pro; 250MB Team)

## 9) Networking & Security (Phase 4)
- [X] Network proxy with per-host allowlist (manifest `net: []`)
- [X] Rate limits per capsule/host; block cross-origin cookies
- [ ] Permission Policy: deny sensors/camera/mic by default
- [ ] CSP tightened; top-navigation disallowed in embeds
- [ ] Quotas and plan enforcement middleware for runs and storage

## 10) Social Layer (Phase 3)
- [X] Likes (optional MVP), Comments (MVP), Follows (MVP)
- [X] Notifications (lightweight MVP ok)
- [X] Remix graph (track parent/child capsule IDs)
- [ ] Profiles: avatar, handle, bio, counts (Runs, Remixes), latest posts

## 11) Moderation & Safety (Phase 4)
- [X] Report flow on posts/comments
- [ ] Quarantine flag + banner; appeal process stub
- [ ] Rate limits on posting/comments/remixes; captcha on spikes
- [ ] Basic keyword filters on titles/descriptions

- [ ] Storage metrics: bundle sizes, plan usage
- [ ] Weekly “Vibe Pack” generation hook and template

## 14) Plans, Pricing, and Quotas (Phase 4)
- [X] Plans created (Free, Creator, Pro, Team) with listed caps
- [ ] Run quotas enforced server-side and surfaced in UI
- [ ] Progress banners for usage (e.g., “Used 74% of your runs”)
- [ ] Overage behavior decided (block/warn/upgrade CTA)

## 15) CI/CD and Quality Gates (All Phases)
- [ ] CI: build, typecheck, lint, unit tests, integration tests
- [ ] Preview deployments on PRs via Cloudflare Pages
- [ ] Secret scan and dependency audits
- [ ] Coverage floors enforced
- [ ] API safety review: new or changed `/api/*` endpoints checked against `api-safety-and-abuse-invariants.mdx`

## 16) Tests and Performance (All Phases)
- [ ] Unit tests for manifest validator, params mapping, utils
- [ ] Integration tests for import/build/publish pipeline (GitHub + ZIP)
- [ ] E2E flows:
  - [ ] Sign in → Import → Publish → Run in Player
